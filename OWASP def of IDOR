"Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) is a vulnerability that arises when
attackers can access or modify objects by manipulating identifiers used in a 
web application's URLs or parameters. It occurs dueto missing access control 
checks, which fail to verify whether a user should be allowed to access
specific data."
